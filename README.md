# vulcanus_rework
Rework and modeling of the vulcanus max printer

# License
We are trying to make sure we've included the license to anything we've pulled in from other projects; if we missed something please let us know and we'll add it ASAP!

# Rendering
To render the printer model, open vulcanus_custom.scad in OpenSCAD. It will take a long time to render the first time -- this is because it'll cache the render so that you can pan/tilt/zoom/etc to look at things.  Most parameters are set in vulcanus_params.scad.

Eventually we plan to have multiple vulcanus_params.scad files for different configurations/sizes of the printer.
